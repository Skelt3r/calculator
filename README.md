# Calculator
As advertised, a simple calculator. It's mostly functional, with a couple of minor issues to be fixed.

Key shortcuts:
- BACK: del
- CLR: end
- +/-: pagedown

All other keys are a direct match. Use numlock for numpad input.

TODO:
- Separate equation and display variables (This will fix inconsistency with +/- and BACK buttons).
- Add equation view above main display.
- Implement button feedback when using Numpad.
